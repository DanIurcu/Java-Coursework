# Java-Coursework
Please upload any modification with appropriate comments.

Our program should be capable of:
1.1 adding a module to the list of modules and creating a folder for it;
1.2 adding a list of coursework expected for each module;
1.3 adding a list of requirements for a specific coursework;
1.4 adding notes to each requirement;
1.5 outputting those notes as a text file so that it can be imported into a word-processed document. ( sort of done? )

Other requirements not in the above list:
-classify everything by module, topic and date
-searching the notes for keywords ( partially implemented )

We should split these tasks evenly.
